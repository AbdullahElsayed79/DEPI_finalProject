# DEPI_finalProject
My final project for Digital Egypt Initiative Pioneers - cisco network adminstration track
This project demonstrates the configuration of a small office network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It involves the creation and management of VLANs for network segmentation, implementation of trunk links to facilitate VLAN communication across switches, and the application of essential security measures such as SSH for secure device access and ACLs (Access Control Lists) to control network traffic.
